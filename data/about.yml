mission: |
 We are a group of students working to connect hospitals in the DC-Maryland-Virginia region with desperately needed supplies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team is also working on independently producing hospital-approved Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other items, with the eventual vision of supporting healthcare workers during this time of crisis and shortage.
