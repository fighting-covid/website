description: While usually used by hobbyist designers to test designs or make something small, 3D printing is an extremely powerful tool. Even though they do require maintenance, it is an especially simple way to help out because the printer does all of the work. I need to go back and make this text better later, there are problems with FDM printers being porous, link to caveats article.

      The Prusa face shield takes much longer than 3DVerkstan to print, but creates a much sturdier and lasting product. For this reason, this design is more ideal for injection molding machines but can be printed using PLA or PETG.

      The 3DVerkstan is the fastest face shield model to 3D print. The thin design makes the finished product very flexible, although a rubber band can be placed between the hooks for a tighter fit. The pegs align with a standard 3-hole punch. The design can be printed out of PLA or PETG.

      Ear savers are small bendable devices that fit behind the head and can hold the mask straps, providing comfort to the user. They take relatively little time to print, but are a great contribution from the maker community to healthcare workers. The design can be printed out of PLA.

      The buckle variation is another form of ear saver that has its own pros and cons. While this design fits more nicely around the head and secures mask straps well, unless the print comes out perfect there is a chance of the hooks snapping off. This design can be printed out of PLA or PETG.

      The door grabber is small device that can fit around a key ring. The main use of the item is to prevent unnecessary contact to elevator buttons and door handles. It is also very easy to clean. The model can be printed out of PLA or PETG.
