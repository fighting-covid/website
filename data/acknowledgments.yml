    info: "While the libraries have been closed, FCPL has sought out opportunities to contribute to the community. Library staff have made many masks for public use, helped assemble face shields, and 3D printed a number of different items for healthcare professionals’ use. We are glad they have chosen to work with YCRO to supply needed personal protective equipment. The following library branches have been 3D printing for YCRO: Centreville, John Marshall, Kings Park, Oakton, Pohick, Reston, Richard Byrd, Thomas Jefferson, Tysons-Pimmit and Woodrow Wilson."

As an architect at HOK DC, finding solutions came naturally to her. With the help of her company’s laser cutter and collaborations with organizations like YCRO, she and her husband Arun Ramlakhan have made and donated over 500 face shields to 15 healthcare facilities.
