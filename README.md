# Project YCRO

Website of Project YCRO (Youth COVID-19 Relief Organization). We are a group of students working to connect hospitals in the DC-Maryland-Virginia region with desperately needed supplies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team is also working on independently producing hospital-approved Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other items, with the eventual vision of support healthcare workers during this time of crisis and shortage.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
